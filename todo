Golf assist

What
An app that a golfer can use to:
- store data of his or her rounds, including putts, strokes, a map etc.
- store DR (trackman range) and other practice data, like putting drills
- Upload images / videos to keep track of swing
- Based on the amount of inputted data, gain tips / drills on how to improve
- Caddy functionality that uses AR to read greens, give distances to hazards on the course and uses wind to guide you through the course

Why
- Become a better player by gaining insight on strengths and weaknesses of their game
- Create a fun, competitive environment for players

How
- Build a massive CSR application, using react, redux, firebase/node as an MVP
- Create a native application with react native

Goals
- Create an MVP: PWA that is hosted and can be used by players to input scores on De Hoge Dijk.
- The long run: Create a native app and scalable platform that can be used by thousands of golfers to compete against eachother, learn from eachother and commit them to the greatest game: golf.
